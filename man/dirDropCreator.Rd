}
\description{
This function returns a function that can be used to create new directories
based on the information returned from the client. The returned function 
takes the name, path and root of the directory to create and parses it into
a platform compliant format and then uses dir.create to create it. The 
returned function returns TRUE if the directory was created successfully and
FALSE otherwise.
